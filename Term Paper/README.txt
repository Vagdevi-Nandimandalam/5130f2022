LinkMinder:
I chose this topic because I don't want people to miss out on any important information. 
For example, a person might wish to read or explore a few websites about a topic on which 
they are working for their research. Friends may have sent a few website links at the time, 
but owing to pressing work or unexplained reasons, we may not have opened every single one. 
We frequently overlook a few spots. So, if we set an alarm for "Sunday 4pm" or any other time
 when we are available, we will be reminded to read the content of that website. 
So that's how we don't miss anything vital.
